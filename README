haitus: a simple virtual machine
version: 0.1


1. what it is:
==============
haitus is a simple virtual machine I've written for no particular
reason other than an experiment.

in the future, I plan to have a compiler for it as well as package it
into a library.

2. how do I use it:
===================
right now, the only method of tracking haitus is the
git repository. you can clone it by doing:

 $ git clone git://github.com/thoughtpolice/haitus.git

after you get it, you'll need to follow these steps to
build it:

 $ make

done. haitus is built in src/, and have a nice day. :)

3. bugfixes/patches
===================
you can email bugfixes and patches to:
  mad.one@killspam.gmail.com (without the 'killspam.' prefix)

if you wish to ask questions, you can use the above address as
well.

haitus: a simple virtual machine using LLVM
version: 0.1


1. what it is:
==============
haitus is a virtual machine I've written, primarily
to play with LLVM.

2. how do I use it:
===================
right now, the only method of tracking haitus is the
git repository. you can clone it by doing:

 $ git clone git://github.com/thoughtpolice/haitus.git

after you get it, you'll need to follow these steps to
install it:

 $ autoreconf --install
 $ ./configure --prefix=$HOME
 $ make
 $ ./src/haitus -h

if you want to use the switch-based interpreter, pass
`CPPFLAGS=-DUSE_SWITCH` to ./configure

done. haitus is installed, and have a nice day. :)

3. bugfixes/patches
===================
you can email bugfixes and patches to:
  mad.one@killspam.gmail.com (without the 'killspam.' prefix)

you may also ask me questions there if you wish.
